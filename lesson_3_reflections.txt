When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    A remote repository can be beneficial when collaborating with other
    programers or when you want to submit work from multiple computers, say
    from work, and then from home.  Having a remote repository allows you to
    'bring' your work with you wherever you go.
    
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because you may not want some of the changes that have been uploaded
	to GitHub.  For instance, if you are collaborating on a project, and
	someone else uploads a new file.  You can look at this file and
	determine if its something you want before including it on your local
	repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A fork is when you take an existing project on GitHub, and clone it.
	All on their servers.  This allows you to modify the poject in any
	way you'd like, and also give credit to the originator of the project.
	A clone is anytime you copy a git repository, either from machine to
	machine, all on GitHub(aka fork) or from  GitHub to your machine.
	A branch is a parallel version of your project, that is in the same
	repository, but is decidedly different in some manner that makes
	you want to keep it separate from the master branch.
