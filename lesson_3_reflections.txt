When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    A remote repository can be beneficial when collaborating with other programers
    or when you want to submit work from multiple computers, say from work, and 
    then from home.  Having a remote repository allows you to 'bring' your work
    with you wherever you go.
