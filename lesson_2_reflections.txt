What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, it creates a .git folder
	containing all the revisions of files in that directory.
	When initialized however, no commits are made (you need to
	commit manually).  You need to do so that the system knows
	you may want to create commits in the future, and makes
	room for you to store them

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is specifically a place to house your
	files before actually making a commit.  Files come from
	your working directory, and they go to the repository.
	In between those two places, they are placed in the
	staging area.  It's advantage is that it bundles files
	together.  For instance, lets say 3 files are added
	to the staging area from the working directory.  When
	those files are added to the repository, they are bundled
	together and added as a whole unit.
